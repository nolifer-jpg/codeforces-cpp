# Codeforces Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to problems from [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/). The solutions are organized by problem rating (difficulty).

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is divided into folders based on the problem rating. While the primary language used is **C++**, there is a specific collection of Python solutions for 800-rated problems.

📝 Note
These solutions are for educational purposes and personal practice. If you are solving these problems yourself, I recommend trying them on your own before looking at the code!
